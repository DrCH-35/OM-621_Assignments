## 📌 Overview  
This repository includes all work completed for **OM 621**, a graduate-level course focused on advanced analytical methods, data transformation techniques, and visualization frameworks for decision-making.  

The course required students to apply real-world analytics workflows using **Python, Power BI, and narrative communication methods**. This repository contains:

- Assignment 1 (3-Minute Story + Storyboard)
- Assignment 2 & Assignment 3 combined into a single, cohesive Python notebook
- Data files, plots, and Power BI dashboard components
- An integrated analytics pipeline demonstrating data preparation, modeling, visualization, and insight communication

## 📘 Assignment 1 — 3-Minute Story & Storyboard  
Assignment 1 required transforming a technical analytics problem into a **clear, compelling narrative** targeted at a professional audience.

### 🎤 **Three-Minute Story — Summary**
The story focused on a real-world analytics challenge involving transportation delays and forecasting transportation cost behavior across different shipping modes.  

The narrative answered three central questions:

1. **What happened?**  
   Delays and cost fluctuations were identified across shipping modes, impacting operational planning and financial predictability.

2. **Why did it happen?**  
   Insights from exploratory analysis revealed key drivers such as travel distance, mode type, variability in lead times, and external performance inconsistencies.

3. **Why does it matter?**  
   Variability in transportation performance directly affects inventory levels, service reliability, and total landed cost.  
   Improving forecasting accuracy helps organizations plan better, reduce waste, and optimize resources.

### 🗂 Storyboard Elements  
The storyboard provided a visual communication plan for guiding executives through the analysis:

- **Scene 1:** Problem introduction — transportation variability and cost uncertainty  
- **Scene 2:** Data landscape — where data originated and what variables were relevant  
- **Scene 3:** Key insights — distribution of delays, comparison of modes, and variability  
- **Scene 4:** Recommendation — strategic actions using analytics to improve forecasting  
- **Scene 5:** Path forward — tools and processes for continued optimization  

This storyboard guided the structure of the Python analysis and Power BI visualizations included in Assignments 2 & 3.

## 📊 Assignment 2 & 3 — Combined Python Notebook  
The notebook **OM621_Assignments_2_and_3_Combined.ipynb** merges Assignments 2 and 3 into a complete, end-to-end analytical workflow.  
It includes:

### 1️⃣ **Data Preparation & Cleaning**
- Importing raw datasets  
- Handling missing or inconsistent values  
- Formatting fields for analysis  
- Creating calculated fields such as delay duration  
- Standardizing column names and data types  

### 2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution visualizations (histograms, boxplots)  
- Trend and pattern identification across modes  
- Summary statistics showing key differences  
- Identification of outliers and high-variance areas  

### 3️⃣ **Feature Engineering & Transformation**
- New metrics to support forecasting  
- Extraction of indicators used in dashboard development  

### 4️⃣ **Results & Insights**
Key findings included:
- Mode-level performance varies significantly, with certain modes showing higher unpredictability  
- Costs correlate strongly with distance and delay behavior  
- Visualizations reveal structurally different time distributions across modes  
- Identified actionable drivers that can be targeted for operational improvements  

Together, these steps formed the analytical backbone for the Power BI dashboard.
